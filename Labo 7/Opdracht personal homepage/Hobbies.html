<p>
Like everyone else, I like to do many different things during my (rare) free time.<br>
Listed below are some of my favorites.
</p><br>
<ul id="UNC">
    <li><strong>Going on adventures (abroad)</strong></li></ul>
I like to go abroad; either by myself, with friends or family. This way, I get to meet new people, travel and see new countries/cultures.<br>
    Most recently, I went to the <a href="https://www.unco.edu/">University of Northern Colorado </a>for a semester.


<br>
<ul id="Reading"><li><strong>Reading</strong></li></ul>
When I don't have anything to do, I like to kick back with a good book.<br>
At this moment, I've given in to the social media hypes and am currently reading a book written by <a
        href="https://sarahjmaas.com/">Sarah J Maas</a>.
<br>
<ul id="Activities"><li><strong>Doing fun activities with friends</strong></li></ul>
When I'm not going on adventures or reading, I like to do fun activities with my friends.
Recently, we've gotten into snowboarding and offroad driving, but when we want to simply go away for a day, we like
to go to places such as: <br>
<a href="https://www.nausicaa.fr/fr">"Nausic√°a"</a> or <a href="https://grotte-de-han.be/nl">"The caves of Han"</a>.
