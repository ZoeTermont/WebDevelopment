      <h2>Life & Career</h2>
      <p>
        Ever since I was young, I've shown a lot of promise on the race-track.<br>
        This might have made me a little bit cocky as I was told I was "arrogant" and "self-centered". Which might or might not have been true.<br><br>
        Anyway, my main goal in life was winning the prestigious Piston Cup and becoming the greatest racer of all time. <br>
        My journey takes an unexpected turn when I get lost on the way to the championship and find myself in the forgotten town of Radiator Springs.<br>
        In Radiator Springs, I meet a diverse group of characters, including Mater, Sally, and Doc Hudson. <br>
        Through their friendships, I come to realize the value of slowing down and enjoying life's simpler pleasures.<br>
        The town becomes a pivotal part of my life, teaching me about community, friendship, and the importance of helping others.<br>
        As I transform from a self-centered racer to a more compassionate individual, I face various challenges in subsequent adventures.<br>
        Such as dealing with high-tech racers, and confronting the inevitability of aging in.<br>
        Throughout these experiences, I continue to learn and grow, ultimately becoming a mentor to a new generation of racers.<br>
        <br>
        In hindsight, my journey is not just about winning on the racetrack; it's a story of personal growth, friendship, and finding meaning beyond individual success.<br>
        Radiator Springs becomes more than a detour—it becomes a home and a place where I discover the true meaning of life beyond the fast lane.<br>
